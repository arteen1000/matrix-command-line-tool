# matrix-command-line-tool

This is a complete matrix command line tool. It is capable of taking in user input and using it to perform matrix operations.

The biggest and most defining feature of this tool is that you are able to input the row data of your matrices and the program will figure out the dimensions for you, providing error checking for different operations. This means that if you're checking your homework answers, or just using this on your desktop, it's fast. Really fast. Much faster than typing all those buttons on your clunky graphing calculator, or at least on mine.

As for the output, if you can blink before it's produced, then you can blink really fast.

As of right now, it can perform the following operations, with more coming soon:

- scalar multiplication
- matrix addition
- matrix multiplication

## basic instructions on how to use

- **This is the most important thing on this page:** once you're done inputting the data for a matrix, and you see `Row X: `, just press ***`Enter`***, and the program will be able to tell that you're done inputting your matrix. This is to allow you to input them as fast as possible, without having to type something like `Done` or `N/A`.

- The program will accept input of the forms `X.X`, `.X`, `-X.X`, `-.X`, but not `X.` or `-X.`. If you would seriously like to format your input in this way, you can file a complaint at arteen1000@gmail.com.

- Please note that matrices cannot have a different number of entries in each row ... i.e, once you choose a certain number of columns, stick with it. The program won't let you input if it doesn't match your initial rows column data.

- I think that's all, and I really doubt you'll have trouble using this, but if you do, you have my email, and I'll be happy to either (a) provide guidance or (b) adjust the program to suit your needs.

## setting up the program

Run these steps, in the order provided, in your terminal, and you'll be good to go:
