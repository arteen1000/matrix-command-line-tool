# matrix-command-line-tool

This is a complete matrix command line tool. It is capable of taking in user input and using it to perform matrix operations. You'll find it's quite strict about the input it'll allow to be received.

The biggest, and most defining feature of this tool is that you are able to input the row data of your matrices, and the program will figure out the dimensions for you, providing error checking for different operations.

You'll also find that it's extremely fast with data. You won't be able to blink before your output is there. I promise.

As of right now, it can perform the following operations, with more coming soon:

- scalar multiplication
- matrix addition
- matrix multiplication

## basic instructions on how to use

- The program will accept input of the forms `X.X`, `.X`, `-X.X`, `-.X`, but not `X.` or `-X.`. If you would seriously like to format your input in this way, you can file a complaint at arteen1000@gmail.com.
